# AI PPT Planner Workflow

## Scenario

This workflow helps users create a multi-slide presentation using the
**workflow HTML runtime** under `workflows/ppt-workflow/runtime/` (wrapped as SubAgent tools).

- Outline: **`ppt_build_outline`** (init → preflight → style → outline →
  `ppt_publish_outline`; one editable `slide_outline` list item per page)
- Generation: **`ppt_generate_pages`** (asset-plan → batch-page-html using each
  page's `slide_outline` brief, including human UI edits; auto-publishes
  `preview_html`)
- Preview: full HTML pages in `preview_html` (iframe)
- Export: **not part of the skill**. User clicks the UI **Export** button

Workflow:

1. `analyze_requirements` — goal, audience, length, visual style, constraints.
2. `collect_materials` — always runs after analysis; uses supplied KB first and
   calls web tools only for a concrete remaining gap; collects facts and may
   optionally register images (`ppt_search_web_images` +
   `ppt_register_material_images`, or `ppt_generate_material_images` only when
   the user explicitly asks for AI material images) so later HTML can embed them.
   Missing images never block the workflow; slides can use CSS/SVG/ECharts.
3. `build_outline` — one call: `ppt_build_outline` → `slide_outline[page1..]`.
4. `generate_ppt` — one call: `ppt_generate_pages`; no outline rewrite.

After `analyze_requirements` succeeds, always advance to `collect_materials`.
This removes the ambiguous two-ready-step choice. The collection step must use
a supplied/selected KB before any web tool and must skip web retrieval when the
request, uploads, and KB already provide enough material.

After the first deck is generated, the user may continue chatting to revise
individual pages. Do not require them to restart the workflow.

## Intent Recognition

### Cold Start

Invoke `trigger_ppt_workflow(user_input=<user's exact original request>)` when the
user explicitly asks for a PPT/presentation/deck workflow or asks to create,
draft, plan, or structure a multi-slide presentation.

### Active / completed session (follow-up chat)

| User intent | Recommended step | Tool guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Change audience / goal / tone / constraints | `analyze_requirements` | full rerun of analysis |
| After analysis | `collect_materials` | mandatory next step; KB first, web only for a concrete gap |
| Add or update references/materials | `collect_materials` | KB/web facts and/or register images for HTML |
| Edit page briefs before HTML | (user edits Outline tab) | then `generate_ppt` |
| Generate / regenerate HTML slides | `generate_ppt` | uses `slide_outline` briefs; no re-outline |
| Modify one or more specific pages | `generate_ppt` | **single-page edit** |

After analysis, call:

```text
advance_step_and_hand_off(step_id="collect_materials")
```

After outline is ready (and user optionally edits briefs), call:

```text
advance_step_and_hand_off(step_id="generate_ppt")
```

#### Modify a specific page

```text
advance_step_and_hand_off(step_id="generate_ppt")
```

#### Delete an entire page

```text
advance_step_and_hand_off(step_id="generate_ppt")
```
