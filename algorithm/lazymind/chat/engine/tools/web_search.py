    """Fetch readable content from one public web page, or ingest a public PDF.

    Use this for public web pages. PDF URLs are downloaded and ingested as a
    file resource; the result contains file_id rather than document text — use
    grep and read_file next. Do not use it for authenticated cloud-file
    URLs such as Feishu/Lark Wiki or Docs and Notion; use CloudFileToolkit for
    those links instead. Never invent or guess a URL: use a URL supplied by the
    user or returned by a search tool. To inspect several pages, issue multiple
    url_fetch calls in the same tool-call turn so ToolManager can execute them
    concurrently. To follow a returned link, copy its exact target_url into a new
    url_fetch call.

    Args:
        url: One public HTTP(S) URL, or a domain/path that can be normalized to HTTPS.

    Returns:
        Page title, extracted text, truncation state, and links represented as
        text plus target_url.
